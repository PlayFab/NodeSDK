NodeSDK README
========
1. Overview:
----
Playfab SDK for node.js applications

This SDK includes all PlayFab APIs (Client, Server, Admin) in a single javascript file suitable for using in node.js.

2. Prerequisites:
----
* Users should be very familiar with the topics covered in our [getting started guide](https://playfab.com/docs/getting-started-with-playfab/).

To connect to the PlayFab service, your machine must be running TLS v1.2 or better.
* For Windows, this means Windows 7 and above
* [Official Microsoft Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380516%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
* [Support for SSL/TLS protocols on Windows](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaushal/archive/2011/10/02/support-for-ssl-tls-protocols-on-windows.aspx)

3. Installation:

The following console command will install the PlayFab NodeSDK.  It requires that you have correctly [installed node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```
npm install playfab-sdk
```

3b. Example testing project:
----

The following console command will install the PlayFab NodeSDK example automated-testing project.  It requires that you have correctly [installed node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
```
npm install playfab-testing
```

To run the test, you need to create a testTitleData.json file, explained below.  You will need to change the testing code to load your file:
```
var filename = "C:/depot/pf-main/tools/SDKBuildScripts/testTitleData.json";
```

Replace the file path with the location of your testTitleData.json file.

4. testTitleData.json file required for example unit-test-project
----

This sdk includes an optional example project that is used by PlayFab to verify sdk features are fully functional.  The testTitleData.json file provides your secret title information to the unit-test project, so it can execute tests in your own PlayFab title.

The format is as follows:

```
{
    "titleId": "your Game Title ID, found in the settings/credentials section of your dashboard on the website",
    "developerSecretKey": "your PlayFab API Secret Key, found in the settings/credentials section of your dashboard on the website - NEVER SHARE THIS KEY WITH PLAYERS",
    "titleCanUpdateSettings": "false",  // "true" or "false", based on your Allow Client to Post Player Statistics option, found in the settings/general section of your dashboard on the website
    "userName": "testUser", // Arbitrary username, you can change this to any valid username
    "userEmail": "your@email.com", // This email address will be bound to the username above
    "userPassword": "testPassword", // This must be the correct password for the testUser above (if that user does not exist yet, this will be the new password)
    "characterName": "testCharacter" // Arbitrary characterName, you can change this to any valid characterName
}
```

5. Usage Instructions:
----
```javascript
var PlayFabClient = require('./PlayFabClient.js')

PlayFabClient.settings.titleId = "F00";

PlayFabClient.GetTitleData({Keys : ["Sample"]}, function(error, result)
{
	if(error)
	{
		console.log("Got an error: ",error);
		return;
	}

	console.log("Reply: ",result);
});
```

Use similar steps to gain access to the PlayFabServer, PlayFabAdmin, and PlayFabMatchmaker APIs.  Additionally, you will need to set your developerSecretKey.  For security reasons you must never expose this value to players.

```
PlayFabClient.settings.developerSecretKey = "your secret key";
```

You can find your titleId and developerSecretKey in the Game Manager -> Settings -> Credentials section for your title: https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/studios
